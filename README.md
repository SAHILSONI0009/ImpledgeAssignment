Approach:

Trie Construction: The code starts by constructing a Trie data structure to store a list of words from the input file.

Queue for BFS: It uses a queue to perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the Trie to explore potential compound words.

BFS Exploration: The BFS starts with each word from the input as a starting point and explores possible compound words.

Suffix Search: For each word, it checks for suffixes in the Trie. If a suffix is found, it is added to the queue for further exploration.

Longest and Second Longest: The code keeps track of the longest compound word and the second-longest compound word found during the BFS traversal.

Timing Execution: It measures the time taken to process the file using the <chrono> library.

Algorithm:

Trie Construction:

A Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character.
The Trie is constructed for all words in the input. For each word:
Starting from the root, it follows the path based on the characters in the word.
For each character, it checks if a corresponding child node exists. If not, it creates one.
The last node of each word is marked as the end of the word.
BFS for Compound Words:

The BFS is used to explore compound words.
It starts with each word as the root of a BFS tree.
For each word, it searches for suffixes in the Trie:
It checks if a suffix exists in the Trie.
If a suffix is found, it is added to the BFS queue for further exploration.
The BFS explores potential compound words by repeatedly adding and removing words from the queue and appending suffixes.
Tracking Longest and Second Longest:

It maintains variables to keep track of the longest and second-longest compound words found during BFS traversal.
When a compound word is found, it checks its length and updates these variables accordingly.
Timing Execution:

It records the start time and end time to measure the execution time using the <chrono> library.
Input and Output:

The code reads words from an input file (e.g., "Input_02.txt") and writes the results to an output file (e.g., "output_02.txt").
It prints the longest and second-longest compound words found and the time taken for processing.
